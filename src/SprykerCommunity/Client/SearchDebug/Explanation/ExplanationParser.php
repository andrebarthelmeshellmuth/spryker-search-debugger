     * `array_flip()` builds the lookup set deliberately: PHP coerces numeric-string array keys to int
     * (so a term like "8845" is stored as int 8845 by {@see TermWeightAccumulator::addTerm()}), and
     * `isset()` applies the same coercion to the lookup key — whereas a strict `in_array()` against the
     * string token list would not match, silently demoting every numeric query token to an "other
     * contribution".
     *
     * A combined synonym-group key (e.g. "button, switch", from {@see TermWeightAccumulator::addSynonym()})
     * is never itself one of the user's query tokens — it's split back into its constituent terms and
     * counted as matched when ANY of them is a real query token (they all originate from the SAME
     * synonym expansion of the query, so in practice either all of a group's terms are query tokens or
     * none are).
